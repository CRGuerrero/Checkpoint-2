<h1>Design Process Strengths and Weaknesses

The design process is typically a 6 part process that involves a lot of strategy and problem solving. The following is how I would rate my current experience with each step of the design process, and why I believe that to be the case. 

1. Discovery: Medium experience level. I believe this is true because in my previous work experience, I have had to communicate with Attorneys, high ranking Military Officials, and Financial Executives in order to assess what their needs are; as well as anticipate future needs. I would not say that I am an Expert in this phase, only because I haven’t utilized my communication skills specifically to design yet. 

2. Strategy: Medium experience level. I believe this is true because this phase includes coming up with ways to fix a new problem. I enjoy trying to work out puzzles and thing through strategy. Shoot, I even play strategy games for fun. However, I can’t say that I am an expert because I have not implemented a strategy for developing a design yet. 

3. Information Architecture: Low experience level. Because I have never attempted to organize information for design, create or test a wireframe, I think my level is pretty low in this area. However, because I have used electronic databases and e-file organization for administrative work, I think those skills should transfer over. Can’t wait to find out. 

4. Visual Design: Medium level. I have some experience with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. However, I have only created a few projects during a semester in college this past Spring semester. Have the basic concept of how to use the tools, but I could use a lot more practice. 

5. Development: Low Level. I have very little experience with code. I have looked at the Markdown Syntax, and I believe that I have the ability to learn and implement the language. So I am excited to see if this will end up as a strength or weakness of mine as the program progresses. 

6. Launch: Low level. Whatever the lowest level of this can be, I’m that. I have never launched something that is usable for the public. The closest thing that I have come to a Launch is changing the background on my “Myspace” page and adding a music player with copied HTML codes.
